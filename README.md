TOXIC Comments Detector using bi-directional RNNs, LSTMs, TextVectorization

-For installing dependencies run in your terminal:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

-I have used python 3.9.0 and tensorflow 2.8.0, if you're using newer version of python, install tensorflow accordingly

-I have uploaded the pre-trained model which is trained for 5 epochs. It seems to be working alright however if you want better results, you can train for more epochs
